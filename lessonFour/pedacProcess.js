PEDAC Process

1. Understanding the Problem
    * Read the problem description
    * Identify inputs and outputs
    * Identify rules and requirements
    * Ask clarifying questions
    * Examine all examples if given

2. Examples/Test cases
    * Understand how the input will translate to output
    * Identify edge cases
        * Can my program handle an empty string, empty array or neg number?
    * Create test cases to confirm your output is correct

3. Data Structures
    * What kind of data are you primarily dealing with?
        * Strings, arrays, numbers, objects, etc
    * Knowing this will help you focus on the right methods to use

4. Algorithm
    * Step by step process to go from input to output
    * Think of your data structures when you’re planning
    * Keep this “high level” in plain words
    * Handles edge cases and has valid example outputs
    * Your code will depend on your algorithm

5. Code
    * Use each process of the above to write your code
    * This will also include time to debug
    * If there are errors, DON’T PANIC
    * Review your algorithm and try again
    * FIRST CHANGE THE ALGORITHM then the code
